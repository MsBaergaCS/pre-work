* Assignment 2

Read sections 1.2 (1.2.1 through 1.2.5) from the [[https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/10elements/][text book]]. 

Choose three of the exercises from the chapter and write programs to
solve them. Note that the solutions are already published in the
book. Attempt them without looking at the solutions first but feel
free to look at solutions to other exercises for assistance.

Add the ~.java~ files for your three solutions to the assignment repos
under a folder named ~pre02~ and push them up to GitHub.
