Read chapter 5 in Think Java.

This section covers conditionals. Java *if* statements look
pretty much the same as those in Javascript 

* Conditionals

#+begin_src java
  // Example A - simple if
  if (boolean) 
    statement; 

  // Example B - if with compound statement
  if (boolean){
      statement1;
      statement2;
      ...;
      statementn;
  }

  // Example C - if with else
  if (boolean){
      statements;
  } else {
      statements;
  }

  // Example D - if with else chain
  if (boolean1) {
      statements;
  } else if (boolean2) {
      statements;
  } else {
      statements;
  }

#+end_src

In Examples B through D, if you don't have multiple statements in each
section you don't need that sections curly braces but it's generally
considered good form to use them. Also, Example D can have any number
of ~else if~ sections.

A Python *if* is similar but different due to its use of indentation
instead of brackets and the explicit elif as opposed to the Java ~else
if~.
